Everything you need for your 90-day transformation."},{question:"How is this different from other planners and journals?",answer:"Unlike traditional planners, Leverage Journal™ combines psychology-backed planning methods with AI technology. Our system includes both physical and digital components that sync in real-time, provides personalized insights based on your progress, and follows a proven 90-day framework with a 94% success rate among users."},{question:"What makes the 90-day system so effective?",answer:"The 90-day timeframe is scientifically proven to be optimal for habit formation and goal achievement. It's long enough to create lasting change but short enough to maintain focus and motivation. Our system breaks down your goals into daily, weekly, and monthly milestones with built-in accountability measures."},{question:"Can I use this for business goals or is it only for personal development?",answer:"The Leverage Journal™ is designed for both personal and professional goals. Many entrepreneurs and business leaders use it for strategic planning, team goal-setting, project management, and business development. The frameworks adapt to any type of goal or objective."}]},{category:"Mobile App & Technology",icon:i.Z,questions:[{question:"How does the mobile app sync with the physical journal?",answer:"The mobile app allows you to input your daily progress, goals, and reflections digitally. While the physical journal is for deep planning and reflection, the app provides quick access, reminders, progress tracking, and AI insights. You can use either or both - they complement each other perfectly."},{question:"Is the mobile app available for both iOS and Android?",answer:"Yes, the Leverage Journal™ app is available for both iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android devices. The app is optimized for all screen sizes and provides the same features across all platforms. You can download it from the App Store or Google Play Store."},{question:"What kind of AI insights does the app provide?",answer:"The AI analyzes your progress patterns, identifies potential obstacles, suggests optimizations to your routine, provides motivational insights based on your goals, and offers personalized recommendations for improving your success rate. The insights become more accurate as you use the system."},{question:"Can I use the system without the mobile app?",answer:"Absolutely! The physical journal is a complete system on its own. The mobile app enhances the experience with digital tracking and AI insights, but you can achieve excellent results using just the journal. Many users prefer the tactile experience of writing by hand."}]},{category:"Ordering & Shipping",icon:l.Z,questions:[{question:"How long does shipping take?",answer:"We offer free worldwide shipping. Standard delivery takes 2-3 weeks for most locations. Express shipping (3-7 business days) is available for an additional fee.

This special pricing helps us build our community and gather feedback. The price will return to \xa339.99 once we reach our target number of users, so we recommend ordering soon to secure this discount."},{question:"What payment methods do you accept?",answer:"We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and bank transfers. All payments are processed securely through Stripe with 256-bit SSL encryption.

If you're not completely satisfied with your Leverage Journal™, return it within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. The journal should be in good condition, and you'll need to cover return shipping costs."},{question:"How do I request a refund?",answer:"To request a refund, email our support team at support@leveragejournal.com with your order number and reason for return. We'll provide return instructions and a prepaid return label. Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after we receive the returned item."},{question:"What if I don't see results after 90 days?",answer:"While our system has a 94% success rate, we understand that results can vary.

We provide step-by-step guidance, examples, and templates to help beginners get started. The system gradually introduces more advanced concepts as you progress through your 90-day journey."},{question:"How much time do I need to spend with the journal each day?",answer:"We recommend 10-15 minutes in the morning for planning and 5-10 minutes in the evening for reflection. This totals about 20 minutes per day. However, you can adapt the system to your schedule - some users prefer longer weekly sessions instead of daily check-ins."},{question:"What if I miss a few days? Can I still be successful?",answer:"Consistency is important, but perfection isn't required. The system is designed to be flexible and forgiving. If you miss a few days, simply pick up where you left off. The app and journal include catch-up strategies and ways to get back on track quickly."},{question:"Can I start at any time of the year?",answer:'Yes! You don\'t need to wait for January 1st or the beginning of a month. The 90-day system works regardless of when you start. Many users find that starting immediately, rather than waiting for the "perfect" time, leads to better results and momentum.'}]}];function b(){let[e,t]=(0,f.useState)([]),[s,i]=(0,f.useState)("all"),l=e=>{t(t=>t.includes(e)?t.filter(t=>t!==e):[...t,e])},c="all"===s?w:w.filter(e=>e.category===s),d=w.flatMap(e=>e.questions);return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(g.default,{page:"faq",faqData:d}),(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-black text-white",children:[(0,a.jsx)("nav",{className:"fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 bg-black/95 backdrop-blur-xl border-b border-yellow-600/30",children:(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8",children:(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex justify-between items-center py-4",children:[(0,a.jsxs)(y.default,{href:"/",className:"flex items-center space-x-3 hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity",children:[(0,a.jsx)(h.Z,{className:"w-5 h-5 text-yellow-400"}),(0,a.jsx)("span",{className:"text-yellow-400 font-medium",children:"Back to Home"})]}),(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex items-center space-x-3",children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.Z,{className:"w-6 h-6 text-yellow-400"}),(0,a.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400",children:"Frequently Asked Questions"})]})]})})}),(0,a.jsx)("main",{className:"pt-24 pb-16",children:(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8",children:[(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"text-center mb-12",children:[(0,a.jsxs)("h1",{className:"text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-6",children:["Frequently Asked ",(0,a.jsx)("span",{className:"text-yellow-400",children:"Questions"})]}),(0,a.jsxs)("p",{className:"text-xl text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-8",children:["Everything you need to know about the Leverage Journal™ 90-day achievement system.
